		<h1>big ideas and small details</h1>
		<p>1. What was the principal topic of today's class?
		The principal topic of today's class was to get organized and acheive a high mark in ICS2O1. We looked at how to organize our binders , and we were given a sheet that lists all the things that we need in our binder. After that we looked at how to be successful in this course , and how to get ready for tests and exams. To be effective it has to be an active process of review, revision, practice, and anticipation. We also learned how to discuss with our classmates on the vpcs forum. Finally to wrap it all up we learned that the theme of ICS(computer science) is "big ideas and small details".</p>
		<p>2. What are the three most valuable things you learnt today? The three most valuable things I learned in class today was how to ask questions to my classmates on the vpcs website on the discussion forum. If I ever had a problem or a question I would go to the vpcs website on the discussion forum and ask my question. I also learned how to create my own webpage using notepad and how to create "magic". Another thing I learned was how to organize my binder and be successful in this class , how to review and study for upcoming tests or quizes. Finally the third thing I learned today was the motto for Computer science which is "big ideas and small details".</p> 
		<p>3. For a quiz intended to check your understanding of today’s principal topic, what would be a great question? A great question for a quiz would be either: what do you think the motto for computer science "big ides and small details" mean? or how do you get to the discussion forum on vpcs website?</p>
