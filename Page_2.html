		<h2>What is Flourine?</h2>
		<p>From the Latin and French word fluere, meaning flow or flux. Fluorine is a chemical element with symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the lightest halogen and exists as a highly toxic pale yellow diatomic gas at standard conditions.</p>
		<h2>Uses of Flourine</h2>
		<p>Flourine as a soluble fluoride in drinking water can help prevent dental cavities, but at 2 ppm it may cause mottled enamel in teeth when used by children acquiring permanent teeth.Elemental fluorine has been studied as a rocket propellant as it has an exceptionally high specific impulse value.</p>
		<h2>Discovery of Flourine</h2>
		<p>Georigius Agricola described the use of fluorspar as a flux in 1529, and as early as 1670 Schwandhard found that glass was etched when exposed to fluorspar treated with acid. Carl Wilhelm Scheele and many other scientists experimented with hydrofluoric acid, with some experiments ending in tragedy. Ferdinand Frederick Henri Moissan, a French chemist, finally isolated the element in 1866.</p>
